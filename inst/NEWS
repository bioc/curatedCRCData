curatedCRCData is a comprehensive resource for clinically-oriented
investigation of the colorectal cancer transcriptome.  It provides
clinically-annotated expression data including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) 
RNASeqV2 and Agilent mRNA microarray datasets.  Probesets are mapped to
official gene symbols using up-to-date maps.  All clinical annotations
are hand-curated and machine-checked to ensure consistent syntax and
maximum retention of available clinical variables. ExpressionSet slots
are populated with numerous metadata including PubMed IDs, citations, 
abstracts, study-specific warnings for retractions and duplicated samples, 
and probeset <--> gene maps.  The package vignette provides examples for selecting
patients and datasets based on flexible rules, performing
meta-analysis of potential biomarkers, creating publication-ready
tables from ExpressionSet metadata, and simple exporting of data
tables for non R-users.
