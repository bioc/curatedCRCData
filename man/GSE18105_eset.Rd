\title{ MUC12 mRNA expression is an independent marker of prognosis in stage II and stage III colorectal cancer. }
\description{ Distant metastasis is the major cause of death in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. To identify genes influencing the prognosis of patients with CRC, we compared gene expression in primary tumors with and without distant metastasis using an oligonucleotide microarray. We also examined the expression of the candidate gene in 100 CRC patients by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR and studied the relationship between its expression and the prognosis of patients with CRC. As a result, we identified MUC12 as a candidate gene involved in metastasis processes by microarray analysis. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR showed that MUC12 expression was significantly lower in cancer tissues than in adjacent normal tissues (p < 0.001). In Stages II and III CRC, patients with low expression showed worse disease-free survival (p = 0.020). Multivariate analysis disclosed that MUC12 expression status was an independent prognostic factor in Stages II and III CRC (relative risk, 8.236; 95\% confidence interval, 1.702-39.849 p = 0.009). Our study revealed the prognostic value of MUC12 expression in CRC patients. Moreover, our result suggests MUC12 expression is a possible candidate gene for assessing postoperative adjuvant therapy for CRC patients. }
